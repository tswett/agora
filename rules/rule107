Rule 107/15 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision.  This notice is invalid if it lacks
      any of the following information, and the lack is correctly
      identified within one week after the notice is published:

      (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
          proposal 4781").

      (b) A description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
          enable public agreement on which persons are eligible.  In
          particular, an explicit list of the eligible voters is
          always sufficient for this purpose.

      (c) A clear indication of the options available.

      (d) The identity of the vote collector.

      (e) Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
          parameters.

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision. Where {X, Y} is a given Speed followed
      by a number of days, the voting period lasts for Y days when the
      Speed is X at the time of initiation: {Slow, 14}, {Normal, 7},
      {Fast, 5}. The minimum voting period for a decision with at
      least two options is five days.  The vote collector for a
      decision with less than two options CAN and SHALL end the voting
      period by announcement, if it has not ended already, and
      provided that e resolves the decision in the same message.

      The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to a
      duration longer than fourteen days.
