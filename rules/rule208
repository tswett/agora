Rule 208/9 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the option selected by Agora.  If
      it was required to be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it as soon
      as possible after the end of the voting period.  To be valid,
      this announcement must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) It is published after the voting period has ended.

      (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

      (c) It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if
          there was more than one valid option, provides a tally of
          the voters' valid ballots on the various options.

      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting
      to the initiator of the decision.  If the vote collector is
      defined by reference to a position (or, in the default case, if
      the initiator was so defined), then the vote collector is the
      current holder of that position.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

      In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
      Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.
