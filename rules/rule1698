Rule 1698 (Power=3)
Agora Is A Nomic

      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
      combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule
      changes to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted
      within a four-week period.

      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
      Agora to become ossified, it cannot take effect, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.  If any other single change to the
      gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, it is cancelled
      and does not occur, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
