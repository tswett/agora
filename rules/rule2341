Rule 2341/0 (Power=1.7)
Judgements by Judicial Panels

      As soon as possible after a judicial panel is assigned to a
      case, each member of the panel SHALL publish an opinion
      indicating a valid judgement to assign to the case -- only the
      last such published opinion for each member is used to determine
      the outcome.  Each member SHOULD choose an appropriate
      judgement, and include arguments for eir choice.

      If, immediately after either all members have so published or
      the time limit for so publishing has ended, a majority of the
      members have opined for the same judgement, the panel acts to
      deliver the judgement in question.  If the panel publishes a
      valid judgement via another mechanism specified in the Rules,
      the requirement for individual members to publish individual
      opinions is waived.

      If an open case is assigned to a judicial panel, and one of its
      members previously published an opinion for that case as part of
      the same or a different judicial panel, then that opinion stands
      for the newly-assigned panel unless the case was judged and
      reopened in the meanwhile.
