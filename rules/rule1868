Rule 1868 (Power=2)
Judge Assignment Generally

      At any time, a judicial case either has no judge assigned to it
      (default) or has exactly one entity assigned to it as judge.
      This is a persistent status that changes only according to the
      rules.

      When a judicial case is open and has no judge assigned, the CotC
      CAN assign a qualified entity to be its judge by announcement,
      and SHALL do so as soon as possible.

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of a judicial
      case are the active first-class players who have not previously
      been assigned as its judge, subject to modification by other
      rules.  Being unqualified to be assigned as a judge does not
      inherently prevent an entity from continuing to be judge of a
      case to which e is already assigned.  Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, entities other than first-class players are
      always unqualified to judge.

      When a player is poorly qualified to be assigned as judge of a
      judicial case, the Clerk of the Courts SHALL not assign em to be
      the judge of that case; if e has done so, and that player is
      still the judge of that case, then e CAN recuse that judge from
      that case by announcement.

      Making an entity unqualified or poorly qualified to judge is
      secured, with a power threshold of 1.5.

      To recuse a judge from a case is to deassign em as its judge.
      Assigning a judge to a case implicitly recuses its existing
      judge, if any.  A recusal "with cause" is a recusal defined as
      such by the rules.

      A player CAN favor or disfavor a judicial case by announcement.
      When assigning a judge to a judicial case, the CotC, if
      possible, SHALL assign a player who has favored it and SHALL NOT
      assign a player who has disfavored it.
