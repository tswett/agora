Rule 2334 (Power=2)
Timers

      A timer is a switch whose values are the non-negative integers
      (default zero), representing a number of seconds.  Timer values
      and changes can be expressed in terms of larger durations (e.g.
      "1 day" is equivalent to "86400 seconds").

      Each timer is either counting down or not counting down.  When a
      timer has been continuously counting down for 1 second since its
      last change, it decreases by 1.

      When reporting a timer value, it is sufficient to provide enough
      information that its value at the time of the report can be
      calculated with reasonable effort (e.g. "<value> as of <date>
      00:00:00 UTC and has been counting down since then").
