Rule 2175/6 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      A new case is a judicial case (other than an appeal case) that
      has not had any judge assigned to it.  The initiator of a new
      case CAN retract it by announcement, thus causing it to cease to
      be a judicial case.

      An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously
      initiated five or more cases during the same week as that case.
      A person SHALL NOT initiate an excess case.  The Clerk of the
      Courts CAN refuse an excess case by  announcement, thus causing
      it to cease to be a judicial case.  When e does so, e fulfills
      any obligations with regards to that case.
