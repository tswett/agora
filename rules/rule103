Rule 103/10 (Power=2)
The Speaker

      The Speaker is an imposed office and a figurehead of Agora. The
      Speaker is a person who has proven themselves to be worthy of
      the title, and for a time can direct Agoran government affairs.

      Each player has a Speaker Account.  The office of Speaker is
      held by the single player whose Speaker Account owns more rubles
      than any other, or is vacant if there is no such player.  At the
      start of each week, each Speaker Account which owns at least as
      many rubles as any other loses one ruble (if it has any).

      The Speaker CAN, by announcement, cause the President to take
      actions that are not otherwise IMPOSSIBLE, except for
      deregistration.  Causing the President to perform ILLEGAL
      actions in this manner is the Class-6 crime of Misleading the
      Leader.

[Cross-references (10 July 2009): the Speaker's duties are:
  * figurehead (Rule 103)
  * bestow favors (Rule 103)]
