Rule 2276 (Power=2)
Assumption of Vacant Offices

      Assumption is an elected office switch, tracked by the IADoP
      with values Postulated (default) and Assumed. Changes to
      Assumption are secured.  An active first-class player can make
      emself the holder of an elected office by announcement, provided
      that the office is either vacant or Assumed.

      Upon doing so, the office's Assumption is flipped to Assumed.

      When the holder of an office ceases to be an active player, the
      office's Assumption is flipped to Assumed.

      When a person comes to hold an office, or would come to hold an
      office if e did not hold it already, by a means other than the
      one provided by this Rule, then the Assumption of that office is
      flipped to Postulated.

      If a player has held an Assumed office continuously since the
      last time it was Postulated, e can flip its Assumption to
      Postulated by announcement.
