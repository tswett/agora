Rule 2357/3 (Power=2)
Wisdom of the Elders

      An Elder is a first-class player who has been registered
      continuously for at least 32 days, and also registered for at
      least 128 days total (not necessarily contiguously).

      An Elder can declare a Gerontocracy with 3 Elder support, unless
      a Gerontocracy was declared within the preceding 28 days.

      During the 32 days after a Gerontocracy is declared:
        * Any Elder CAN flip any non-Elder to supine by announcement;
        * Any Elder CAN flip any office held by a non-Elder to Assumed
          by announcement;
        * Non-Elders CANNOT Assume offices, even if other rules say
          they can;
        * Any Elder, with 4 Elder Support, CAN set the Adoption Index
          of any Agoran Decision with an Adoption Index to 8.
        * If 5 or more Elders are Objectors to an intent, Agora is not
          Satisfied with that intent, rules to the contrary
          notwithstanding. Any Elder is eligible to object to any
          intent, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
