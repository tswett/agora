Rule 1367/16 (Power=3)
Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees.  The degrees are

      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)
      - Master of Nomic                    (M.N.)
      - Doctor of Nomic History            (D.N.Hist.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Science            (D.N.Sci.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil.)

      Degrees are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with
      degrees listed later being ranked higher.

      A degree CANNOT be awarded to any person more than once, and
      CANNOT be revoked once awarded.

      After a player publishes a suitable thesis with explicit intent
      to qualify for a degree (the specific degree need not be
      mentioned), the Herald SHALL, as soon as possible, initiate an
      Agoran Decision to award that player (the author) a degree as
      follows:

       - The available options are FAILING GRADE and each degree that
         the author does not have. The available options can change
         during the voting period.

       - The eligible voters are each active player at the time the
         decision is initiated.

       - Each player's voting limit on the decision is one plus the
         number of degrees e holds.

       - The specific thesis for which the degree is to be awarded is
         an essential parameter of the decision (but not the text of
         that thesis).

       - The outcome is, rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
         highest-ranked degree such that more than half the votes cast
         were for that degree or a higher degree, or FAILING GRADE if
         there was no such degree.

      When the Herald resolves the decision, e CAN and SHALL award the
      author the degree selected by Agora, or no degree if FAILING
      GRADE was the outcome.
