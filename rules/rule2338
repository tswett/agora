Rule 2338 (Power=3)
Cashing Promises

      An entity CAN cash a promise in eir possession by announcing
      that e does so, provided either that all conditions required to
      be true for the promise to be cashed are true, or it has no such
      conditions.  To do so, e must clearly and unambiguously identify
      the promise and SHOULD publish its text.

      When a promise is cashed, the text of the promise is interpreted
      as if it were published by its author as a standalone statement;
      if that statement requires additional context, that context MUST
      be supplied within the body of the message indicating the
      cashing.  Cashing a promise destroys it, unless the promise has
      at least one condition required to be true for it not to be
      destroyed when cashed, and all such conditions are true.

      If a promise is possessed by the Tree, any player except the
      promise's author CAN transfer it to emself by announcement, if e
      cashes the promise in the same message in which e transfers it
      to emself.

      Horton CAN destroy any promise Without Objection.
