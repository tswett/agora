      Citizenship is an entity switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the registrar.  A player is
      an entity whose citizenship is Registered.  Changes to
      citizenship are secured.

      The verb "to be registered" means to become a player (i.e., to
      have one's citizenship changed from Unregistered to Registered),
      and the verb "to be deregistered" means to cease to be a player
      (i.e., to have one's citizenship changed from Registered to
      Unregistered).  Where the verb "to register" or "to deregister"
      is used without an explicit direct object, the action is
      implicitly reflexive.

      A first-class person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
      indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
      intends to become a player at that time.

      A second-class person CAN register with Agoran Consent.

      A non-person CANNOT be registered (or created in a Registered
      state), rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

      A player CAN deregister by announcement.  A person CANNOT
      register within thirty days after being deregistered, unless
      rules define the method of deregistration as passive.

      A player who is not a person and has never been a first-class
      person CAN be deregistered by any player by announcement.

      Initiating a frivolous judicial case on the success or failure
      of a registration attempt is the Class-3 crime of Hazing.
