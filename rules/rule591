Rule 591 (Power=1.7)
Inquiry Cases

      Inquiry cases are a subclass of judicial cases.  An inquiry
      case's purpose is to determine the veracity of a particular
      statement.  Any first-class person CAN initiate an inquiry case
      by announcement, specifying a block of text which SHOULD
      represent a statement to be inquired into.  (Including a yes/no
      question is equivalent to including a statement that the answer
      to that question is yes, and for such a case, YES and NO are
      synonymous with the judgements TRUE and FALSE respectively.)

      The initiator is unqualified to be assigned as judge of the
      case, and in the initiating announcement e CAN disqualify one
      person from assignment as judge of the case.

      The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based
      on the truth or falsity of the statement at the time the inquiry
      case was initiated:

      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false

      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
        true

      * UNDECIDABLE, appropriate if the statement was logically
        undecidable or otherwise not capable of being accurately
        described as either false or true

      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
        extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that
        don't actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined
        from the outcome of another (possibly still undecided)
        judicial case that was not itself judged IRRELEVANT

      * UNDETERMINED, appropriate if the statement is nonsensical or
        too vague, or if the information available to the judge is
        insufficient to determine which of the FALSE, TRUE, and
        UNDECIDABLE judgements is appropriate; however, uncertainty as
        to how to interpret or apply the rules cannot constitute
        insufficiency of information for this purpose

      * MALFORMED, appropriate if the text identified by the initiator
        as the statement cannot be parsed as a single statement in the
        ordinary-language sense; however, a compound statement (e.g.
        "X and Y", "X or Y") counts as a single statement

      Players SHOULD take the judgement of the question in an inquiry
      case, and the reasoning by which it was reached, into account
      when attempting to determine what is possible and/or legal in
      future play (including when making future judgements); but the
      judgement does not directly affect the veracity of the
      statement.
