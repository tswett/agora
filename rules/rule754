Rule 754 (Power=3)
Definition Definitions

      Regularity of communication being essential for the healthy
      function of any nomic, it is hereby resolved:

      (1) A difference in spelling, grammar, capitalization, or
          dialect, or the use of a synonym or abbreviation in place of
          a word or phrase is inconsequential in all forms of
          communication, as long as the difference does not create an
          ambiguity in meaning, except for the purpose of reporting on
          or quoting the text of a legal document.  A difference
          between two nonempty spans of whitespace is inconsequential
          in all forms of communication for all purposes.

      (2) A term explicitly defined by the Rules, along with its
          ordinary-language synonym not explicitly defined by the
          rules, by default has that meaning when used in any Rule of
          equal or lesser power, as well as any Rule of greater power
          that is clearly intended to comply with that meaning.

          The following clauses, where X and Y are both nouns or noun
          phrases, mean "X is/are defined as Y" unless they obviously
          have a different meaning:

            a) "X is/are Y"
            b) "Y is/are known as X"

      (3) Any term primarily used in mathematical or legal contexts,
          and not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule, by
          default has the meaning it has in those contexts.

      (4) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          by default has its ordinary-language meaning.

      In determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term,
      definitions contained in lower-powered Rules, are relevant and
      may provide guidance in helping to determine the meaning of a
      rule, but are not binding (especially if they differ greatly
      from the definitions that would be used otherwise).

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules which dictate
      terminology or grammar.
