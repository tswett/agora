Rule 1586 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      If multiple rules attempt to define an entity with the same
      name, then they refer to the same entity.  A rule-defined
      entity's name CANNOT be changed to be the same as another
      rule-defined entity's name.

      A rule referring to an entity by name refers to the entity that
      had that name when the rule first came to include that
      reference, even if the entity's name has since changed.

      If the rules are amended such that they no longer define an
      entity, then that entity and its attributes cease to exist.

      If the rules are amended such that they define an entity both
      before and after the amendment, but with different attributes,
      then that entity and its attributes continue to exist to
      whatever extent is possible under the new definitions.
