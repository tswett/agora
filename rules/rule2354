Rule 2354/0 (Power=1)
Costs

      The documents defining the conditions for performing an action
      can specify another action as a cost; paying the cost becomes a
      condition for performing the original action.  A person has paid
      the cost for an attempt to perform an action if e performed each
      action so defined as a cost:

      (1) in the same message as the attempt,
      (2) clearly indicating that the action was a payment of that
          cost for that attempt, and
      (3) not indicating that it was a payment for any other cost or
          attempt.

      If the cost is defined in assets, the required action is
      destroying those assets, or, if the documents specify a
      recipient entity, transferring them to that entity.
