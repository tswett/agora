Rule 2358/1 (Power=1)
Win by Paradox

      A turtle is an inquiry case on the possibility or legality of a
      rule-defined action (actually either occurring, performed, or
      attempted, but not arising from that case itself, and not
      occurring after the initiation of that case) which has the
      judgement UNDECIDABLE.

      When a turtle has continuously been a turtle for one week, its
      initiator satisfies the Victory Condition of Paradox.
