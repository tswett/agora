Nomic Definitions

      A nomic is a system of rules that provides means for itself to
      be amended arbitrarily. Nomics can be games, micronations,
      simulations, and/or sovereign states.

      A foreign nomic is a nomic other than this one, even if it has
      the same name as this one.

      A protectorate is a foreign nomic which specifies in its ruleset
      that it is a Protectorate Of Agora and which allows Agora to
      make arbitrary amendments to it.
