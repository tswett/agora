Rule 2318 (Power=1.7)
Motions to Reconsider

      If a non-Appeals judicial case (1) has a judgement that has been
      in effect for less than seven days and not been appealed, and
      (2) has not had a Motion to Reconsider filed for it at any time
      while it has been assigned to its current judge, then any Player
      CAN file a Motion to Reconsider the case with 2 Support, or by
      announcement if e is that case's judge.

      When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed, the case is rendered
      open again.  A player who files such a Motion SHOULD include
      arguments as to why the case needs reconsideration, and such
      arguments become part of the record of the case.
