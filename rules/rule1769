Rule 1769 (Power=3)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time designated as such by the Rules.

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin
      after 2 January is a Holiday.

      During a Holiday, the Promotor SHALL NOT distribute any
      proposals, and the Clerk of the Courts SHALL NOT assign a judge
      to any judicial case, and judges SHALL NOT assign judgement to
      any judicial case.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event (including the
      time limit to perform an action) upon the time of another event,
      and

      a) that other event occurs during a Holiday, then the time at
         which that Holiday ends shall be used instead for the purpose
         of determining the time of the future event.

      b) the future event would occur during a Holiday or during the
         72 hours immediately following a Holiday, then the future
         event occurs 72 hours after the end of that Holiday instead.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require events to be
      performed before a specified time.
