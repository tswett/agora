Rule 2367 (Power=3)
Messy Statements

      A statement is messy if its truth value cannot be evaluated in a
      top-down fashion without encountering some form of infinite
      regress, such as (but not limited to) self-reference.

      For the purposes of the rules, messy statements are considered
      inaccurate and incorrect regardless of their truth value.
