Rule 2351 (Power=3)
Agora, Adult

      Agora can make its own decisions. If, at any time, Agora wishes
      to counteract a decision, then that decision, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding, has no effect. The game of Agora, but
      not any other player of it, can make arbitrary changes to the
      gamestate.
