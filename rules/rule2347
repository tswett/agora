Rule 2347/1 (Power=2)
Speed

      The Speed switch is an Agora Nomic switch, tracked by the
      Assessor, with values of Slow, Normal (default) and Fast. The
      Speed switch is secured.

      When the Speed has not been changed in the past month, the
      President CAN flip the Speed to Normal or Fast by announcement.
      At any time, players CAN flip it to a given value with Agoran
      Consent. In case of a lull, players CAN flip it to Slow without
      objection.
