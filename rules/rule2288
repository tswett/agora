Induction

      If a person CAN perform an action by announcement, e CAN perform
      it with N support, without N objections, with N Agoran Consent,
      or with notice, where N is a number appropriate for that form of
      dependent action.

      If a person CAN perform an action with notice, e CAN perform it
      without N objections, where N is an appropriate number.

      If a person CAN perform an action with M support, e CAN
      perform it with N support, where N is an appropriate number
      greater than M.

      If a person CAN perform an action without M objections, e CAN
      perform it without N objections, where N is an appropriate
      number less than M.

      If a person CAN perform an action via multiple different means
      of dependent actions, e CAN perform that action via multiple of
      them at the same time.

      If a player CAN perform an action with 0 support, then e CAN
      perform it by announcement.
