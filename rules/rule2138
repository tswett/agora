Rule 2138 (Power=1)
The Interstellar Associate Director of Personnel

      The Interstellar Associate Director of Personnel (IADoP) is an
      office; its holder is responsible for keeping track of officers
      and reports.

      The IADoP's report includes the following:

      a) The holder of each office.
      b) The date on which each holder last came to hold that office.
      c) The date when the most recent nomination period for that
         office began.
      d) The date when that office's reports were last published.

      The portion of a public message purporting to be an IADoP's
      report that lists the holder of each office is self-ratifying.
