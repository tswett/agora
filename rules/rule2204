Rule 2204/0 (Power=1.5)
Linked Assignments

      When the Clerk of the Courts assigns a player as judge of two or
      more judicial cases consecutively in the same announcement, that
      player only becomes sitting upon the last such assignment, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.  The CotC SHOULD NOT do this
      unless those cases are closely related in their subject matter.
