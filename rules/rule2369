Rule 2369/2 (Power=1)
Foreign Relations

      Recognition is a foreign nomic switch, tracked by the
      Ambassador-At-Large, with values Unknown (default), Protected,
      Friendly, Neutral, Sanctioned, Hostile, and Abandoned. Players
      SHOULD not violate the rules of Protected or Friendly nomics.

      When a non-Unknown foreign nomic becomes a Protectorate, it's
      recognition becomes Protected.  When a foreign nomic ceases to
      be a Protectorate, its Recognition becomes Unknown. Any person
      CAN flip an Unknown Protectorate's Recognition to Protected by
      announcement.  A foreign nomic's Recognition CANNOT change to or
      from Protected in any other way.

      The Ambassador-At-Large CAN, with Agoran Consent, flip a foreign
      nomic's Recognition to any value (subject to the above
      restriction).  E SHALL inform that nomic of the change as soon
      as possible.

      Any Ambassador Extraordinary And Plenipotentiary to a foreign
      nomic CAN by announcement flip its Recognition to any value
      (subject to the above restriction).  E SHALL inform that nomic
      of the change as soon as possible.
