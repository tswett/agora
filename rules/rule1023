Common Definitions

      The following terms are defined:

      (a) The phrases "in a timely fashion" and "as soon as possible"
          mean "within X days", where X is 14 when the Speed is Slow,
          7 when it is Normal and 5 when it is Fast. This time period
          is set when the requirement is created (ie. X days before
          the limit ends). A requirement to perform an action at an
          exact instant (e.g.  "when X, Y SHALL Z"), but not "in the
          same message", is instead interpreted as a requirement to
          perform that action in a timely fashion after that instant.

      (b) Agoran epochs:

          (1) Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.

          (2) Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday.

          (3) Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.

          (4) Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.

          (5) Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.

          (5) A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
              (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at
              which at least one person won the game.  When used as a
              period of time, a "game" is the period of time between a
              pivot and the next pivot.

          These definitions do not apply to relative durations (e.g.
          "within <number> days after <event>").
