Rule 2150/6 (Power=3)
Personhood

      A person is an entity defined as such by rules with power of at
      least 2.  A person CAN generally be the subject of rights and
      obligations under the rules.

      Any biological organism that is generally capable of
      communicating by email in English (including via a translation
      service) is a person.

      A first-class person is a person of a biological nature.  All
      other persons are second-class.

      The basis of a first-class person is the singleton set
      consisting of that person.
