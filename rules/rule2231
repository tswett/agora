Rule 2231/3 (Power=3)
Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic

      The set of patent titles defined in this rule constitute the
      Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic; the titles may be collectively
      referred to as "Heroic titles" and a Bearer of a Heroic title as
      a Hero.

      Heroic titles are Agora's premier titles of distinction, and CAN
      be awarded to persons for meritorious service only by a proposal
      of power 3 or greater, which SHOULD explain why those persons
      are qualified.  Players SHOULD NOT cause heroic titles to be
      revoked.  Heroes are entitled to use the abbreviation of eir
      title as post-nomial letters in Agora communications and
      reports.

      The Heroic titles in decreasing precedence are:

      Grand Hero of Agora Nomic (GHAN) -- This title may be awarded to
      any person obviously and directly responsible for the existence
      of Agora and/or Nomic in general.  As this title is the highest
      honour that Agora may bestow, a Bearer of this title OUGHT to be
      treated right good forever.

      Hero of Agora Nomic (HAN) -- This title may be awarded to any
      person for outstanding meritorious service to Agora above and
      beyond the call of duty.
