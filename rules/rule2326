Rule 2326/3 (Power=2)
The President

      The President is a second-class person.  Causing the President
      to act is secured.

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the President CANNOT be
      deregistered.

      A first-class Player CAN cause the President to take actions
      Without Objection, or with Agoran Consent.

      Should the President incur obligations under the Rules, then the
      Speaker SHALL act to satisfy these obligations.
