Rule 649 (Power=1.5)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal item given in recognition of a
      person's distinction.  The Herald is an office; its holder is
      responsible for tracking Patent Titles.

      A person specifically authorized by the rules to award (revoke)
      a Patent Title SHALL do so as soon as possible after the
      conditions authorizing em to do so are announced, unless there
      is an open judicial case contesting the validity of those
      conditions.  Awarding or revoking a Patent Title by any other
      method is secured.

      While a Patent Title has been awarded to (and not revoked from)
      an entity, that entity is said to Bear that Patent Title.  The
      status of Bearing a Patent Title can only be changed as
      explicitly set out in the Rules.  The Herald's monthly report
      includes a list of each Patent Title that at least one entity
      Bears, with a list of which entities Bear it.

      As soon as possible after a patent title is awarded or revoked,
      the herald SHALL announce the award or revocation.

      When a patent title is used as a noun to refer to bearers of the
      patent title, it is assumed to refer only to persons who Bear
      that patent title unless context clearly indicates otherwise.
