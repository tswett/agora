Rule 2143/15 (Power=1)
Official Reports and Duties

      For each office:

      a) If any task is defined by the rules as part of that office's
         weekly duties, then the holder of that office SHALL perform
         it at least once each week, except if the Speed is Slow, in
         which case the duties SHALL be completed once each fortnight.
         If any information is defined by the rules as part of that
         office's weekly report, then the holder of that office SHALL
         maintain all such information, and the publication of all
         such information is part of that office's weekly duties.

      b) If any task is defined by the rules as part of that office's
         monthly duties, then the holder of that office SHALL perform
         it at least once each month.  If any information is defined
         by the rules as part of that office's monthly report, then
         the holder of that office SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of that office's monthly duties.

      Any information defined by the rules as part of an office's
      report, without specifying which one, is part of its weekly
      report.  Failure of the holder of an office to perform any duty
      required of that office within the allotted time is the Class-2
      crime of Tardiness.

      While performing weekly or monthly duties or publishing weekly
      or monthly reports, officers SHALL NOT publish information that
      is inaccurate or misleading.

      Reports SHALL be published in plain text.  Tabular data must
      line up properly when viewed in a monospaced font.  Publishing a
      report that deviates from these regulations is the Class 2 Crime
      of Making My Eyes Bleed.
