Rule 1950/26 (Power=3)
Decisions with Adoption Indices

      Adoption index is a switch possessed by Agoran decisions and
      proposals, whose value is either "none" (default) or an integral
      multiple of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9.

      Chamber is a switch possessed by Agoran decisions with adoption
      indices and proposals, with values any Voting Chamber, by
      default Ordinary.

      Adoption index and Chamber are secured with a power threshold of
      2.

      An Agoran decision with an adoption index has the following
      essential parameters:

      a) Its adoption index.
      b) Its author (and co-authors, if any).
      c) Its Chamber.

      The eligible voters on a decision with an adoption index are
      those entities that were active first-class players at the start
      of its voting period.  Setting or changing an entity's voting
      limit on such a decision is secured with a power threshold of 2
      if the decision is Ordinary, or 3 otherwise.

      For any Agoran decision with an adoption index, the available
      options are FOR and AGAINST.
