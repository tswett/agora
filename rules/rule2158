Rule 2158 (Power=2)
Judges

      At any time, each judicial case is either open (default),
      suspended, or has exactly one judgement.  This is a persistent
      status that changes only according to the rules.  The possible
      types of judgement for a judicial case depend on the type of
      case.

      When a judicial case is open and has a judge assigned to it, the
      judge CAN assign a valid judgement to it by announcement, and
      SHALL do so as soon as possible, unless e is recused from the
      case before the time limit for doing so has expired.  A judge
      SHOULD NOT assign an inappropriate judgement to any judicial
      case.  A judgement is valid and/or appropriate only as defined
      by the rules.  Defining these things is secured, with a power
      threshold of 1.7.  If more than one judgement is valid and
      appropriate, then the choice between them is left to the judge's
      discretion.

      When a non-appeal judicial case is open, and its judge has
      violated a time limit to assign a judgement to it, or is not an
      active player, the Clerk of the Courts SHALL recuse that judge
      with cause by announcement as soon as possible; however, this
      requirement is waived if the judge assigns a judgement to it
      first.
