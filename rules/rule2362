Rubles

      Rubles are a currency.  The General Secretary is an office, and
      the recordkeepor of rubles.

      At the start of each week, half of each person's rubles (rounded
      up to the nearest integer) are destroyed, then two rubles are
      created in the possession of each first-class player.

      At the start of each month (after weekly destruction, if it
      coincides with the start of a week), each player gains a ruble
      for each Postulated office e holds, and  each active first-class
      player whose Posture has not been supine or leaning at any time
      during the past month gains a ruble.
