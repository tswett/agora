Rule 2164/4 (Power=1)
Judicial Self-Recusal and Case Transfer

      The judge of a judicial case CAN recuse emself from it at any
      time by announcement.  Such a recusal is with cause if and only
      if e has been assigned to the case for at least four days.

      An entity (the transferee) CAN, with consent from the current
      judge of a judicial case (the transferor), assign emself as the
      new judge of that case, provided that e is qualified to be
      assigned as judge of that case, and e immediately (in the same
      announcement) assigns a judgement to that case.
