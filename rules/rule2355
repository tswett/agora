Rule 2355/0 (Power=1.1)
For It Was Not To B

      WHEREAS B Nomic, a well-played Nomic, did claim to pass a
      proposal directing a player to end the game, where that person
      fled B in hopes of never having to use that terrible power; and

      WHEREAS B Nomic was in fact recently discovered to have been
      locked in perpetual Emergency since 2002, such that its game can
      never advance; and

      WHEREAS B Nomic's imagined gameplay did at one point submit to
      being a Protectorate of Agora, indicating its consent to be
      ruled by the most glorious of Nomic; and

      WHEREAS B Nomic's imagined gameplay did later adopt the entire
      Ruleset of Agora, indicating true reverence as imitation is the
      sincerest form of flattery; and

      WHEREAS B Nomic was renowned for its pedantry, a true virtue
      among Nomics; and

      WHEREAS Agora should honour its Protectorates, even those that
      departed it and, in fact, was never actually able to submit to
      Agora's rule; and

      WHEREAS Agora should honour any Nomic deserving of true
      greatness;

      BE IT HEREBY PROCLAIMED that the entirety of June 5th in each
      year be observed in Agora as B Nomic Memorial Day; and

      BE IT ALSO HEREBY PROCLAIMED that on B Nomic Memorial Day,
      players should exhibit legendary pedantry and attempt to find
      places in Agoran history where the rules were misapplied with
      still-lasting effects.
