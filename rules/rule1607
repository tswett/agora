Rule 1607/35 (Power=3)
Distribution

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      receiving and distributing proposals.

      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
      For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the
      adoption index and Chamber are initially the same as the
      corresponding values from the proposal, and the text of the
      proposal is an essential parameter.  Initiating such a decision
      is known as distribution, and removes the proposal from the
      Proposal Pool.

      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time.  In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL,
      as part of eir weekly duties, distribute all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool that were in the Pool at the beginning of that
      week.

      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.

      If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
      IMPOSSIBLE for any active player to distribute, then any player
      CAN distribute that Proposal Without 3 Objections.

      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool.  This portion of a public message purporting to
      be a Promotor's report is self-ratifying.
