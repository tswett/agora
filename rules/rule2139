Rule 2139/4 (Power=2)
The Registrar

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of players.

      The Registrar's report includes:

      a) A list of all players, including information sufficient to
         identify and contact each player.
      b) The date on which each player most recently became a player.
      c) The Activity of each player, and when each Inactive player
         became Inactive.
      d) For each former player for which the information is
         reasonably available, the dates on which e registered and
         deregistered.

      The portion of a public message purporting to be a Registrar's
      report that lists each player implies that no players other than
      those listed exist and is self-ratifying.

      The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches that
      would otherwise lack an officer to track them.
