Rule 2337 (Power=3)
Promises

      Promises are a class of assets.  Horton is an Office and the
      recordkeepor for promises; Horton's weekly report includes the
      text, author, conditions, and owner of all existing promises.
      The Tree is an entity for holding promises.  Ownership of
      promises is limited to persons, judicial panels, and the Tree.

      A Player (the promise's author) CAN create a promise in eir
      possession by announcement, clearly specifying its text.
      Optionally, the author CAN, in the creating message, specify one
      or more conditions required to be true for the promise to be
      cashed, and/or one or more conditions required to be true for
      the promise not to be destroyed when cashed.

      To submit a promise means to create that promise and then
      transfer it to the Tree.

      Promises with the same text, author, and conditions are
      fungible.

      Creating and cashing promises is secured with power threshold 3;
      any other modifications to promise holdings are secured with
      power threshold 2.
