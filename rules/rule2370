The Ambassador-At-Large

      The Ambassador-At-Large is an office; its holder is responsible
      for relations with foreign nomics.

      A foreign nomic may grant certain powers (in the
      ordinary-language sense) and privileges to Agora's ambassadors.
      It is ILLEGAL to use or attempt to use such powers or privileges
      except as allowed by the rules of Agora. The Ambassador-At-Large
      CAN and MAY, with Agoran Consent, authorize emself to use such
      powers or priviliges in a specified way, in a specified nomic,
      in a specified timeframe of length not exceeding two weeks. If a
      foreign nomic allows for Agora to take actions in it, the
      ambassador CAN and MAY, with Agoran consent, take a specified
      action or series of actions in it on behalf of Agora, provided
      that the nomic is Protected, Friendly, or Neutral.

      It is ILLEGAL to falsely claim, to any nomic, to be an
      ambassador of Agora. The Ambassador-At-Large SHALL inform any
      nomic that recieves such a claim of its falsehood as soon as
      possible.
